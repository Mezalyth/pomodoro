# WriteAway
A sprint-focused app built for authors, writers, and anyone who needs to get the words out.

## Features
### Rich Text Editing
Headlines, highlights, emphasis, you name it. The tools you need to author your masterpiece come baked in.

### <- Notes and Tasks
Write your themes, notes to self, and goals for your sprint.

### -> Pomodoro Timer
Stay focused with the Pomodoro technique, breaking down your work and rest into an efficient pattern.

### Focus Mode
When you start writing, everything else fades away. Focus on your goals and accomplish your work.

### Customizable Sprint Goal
The default is set to 1,667 (to accomplish a 50,000 word per month goal), but you can change your goals at anytime. Tailor your sprint goal to you. The progress bar doesn't stop at 100%.

### Quick-Copy Button
Tap the button to save your work to your clipboard (it keeps the formatting!) to easly paste to your main document.

## Notes
This app saves data to your browser's local storage; meaning that it's not cloud-based, and if the cache is cleared, your work is gone. Don't let that happen; make sure you copy to your main doucument! This app is built for sprints, not complete projects.
